# AdvancedStatistics_Project
Authors: Margarita Shnaider, Lorenzo Martinelli.

Final project for the exam Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis, part of the master's degree cycle in Physics of Data delivered at UNIPD.

## Outline
The project's goal is to develop a very simple Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) for fake news classification. The simple model is trained on an extensive set of pieces of information, before being tested on similar headlines or articles. The results are then validated through a simple metric, that being using a confusion matrix. On top of this, the notebook goes through the bases of natural language processing, which is a tool naturally used to developd the NBC. Ultimately, using two different datasets with different levels of complexity, the project proves that even a very simple model such as this one, which takes only a handful of miniutes to train, can succeed in some scenario, though it fails to capture more complex patterns or contexts.

The whole project has been carried out in R.
